Here's a breakdown of the project into major pillars, with subtasks that you can approach incrementally. This structure also aligns with building a business around it:


---

1. Data Extraction Layer (ERCOT Data Pipeline)

Goal: Continuously ingest, clean, and store ERCOT data (prices, loads, plant info, etc.)

Tasks:

[ ] Identify and document all relevant ERCOT APIs and data sources (real-time, day-ahead, SCED, outages, etc.)

[ ] Build and test ingestion scripts (use a job scheduler like cron or Airflow)

[ ] Design a database schema to store time series data (e.g., DuckDB or PostgreSQL)

[ ] Normalize data (e.g., consistent timestamps, plant names, units)

[ ] Add logging + monitoring for failed pulls or schema changes

[ ] Create a small dashboard or status API to monitor health of data ingestion



---

2. LLM-Based Dashboard Generator (User-Facing Smart Visuals)

Goal: Enable users to generate insightful visualizations with natural language.

Tasks:

[ ] Define prompt engineering strategy for visual generation (e.g., "Show me price trends over last 30 days")

[ ] Choose LLM stack (e.g., OpenAI, Claude, local models) and build an initial prototype

[ ] Design a visualization engine (e.g., Altair, Plotly, Vega-Lite) to render charts based on structured queries

[ ] Link natural language to ERCOT data via SQL/DSL generator (e.g., LLM → SQL → chart)

[ ] Build a minimal web interface for interaction (e.g., Streamlit, Next.js, Genie.jl)

[ ] Add caching or query optimization to avoid re-running expensive queries



---

3. Modeling Toolkit (Price Prediction + Battery Optimization)

Goal: Provide power users with tools to model and simulate energy price behavior or asset optimization.

Tasks:

[ ] Package historical ERCOT data for easy use in ML models (clean, labeled datasets)

[ ] Build a forecasting baseline model (e.g., ARIMA, XGBoost, Prophet, or LSTM)

[ ] Build or integrate a battery optimization module (Julia/JuMP is a great fit)

[ ] Wrap forecasting + optimization in simple API or notebook-based interface

[ ] Document and test with sample battery profiles and customer use cases

[ ] Allow users to bring their own data or adjust assumptions



---

4. Integration Layer (Making it Work Together)

Goal: Ensure all components (data, dashboards, models) work as a unified platform.

Tasks:

[ ] Build unified API endpoints to access data, generate charts, run models

[ ] Define user authentication & authorization (basic login + permissions)

[ ] Use containerization (Docker) to isolate services

[ ] Choose orchestration (Docker Compose or Kubernetes if needed)

[ ] Log user interactions for improvement & debugging

[ ] Think about how to scale each layer independently (data, LLM, UI)



---

5. Business & Delivery Model (Monetization + Access)

Goal: Turn the system into a usable and sellable SaaS product.

Tasks:

[ ] Define customer segments (solar farms, battery operators, consultants, traders)

[ ] Design pricing model (per-user, per-call, flat monthly, freemium tier?)

[ ] Choose authentication + payment (e.g., Stripe, Firebase, OAuth)

[ ] Build a subscription and account management portal

[ ] Create demos and tutorials to onboard users

[ ] Define metrics for success (daily active users, model runs, chart generations)

Suggested Order for Development (Solo in Spare Time)

1. Data Ingestion – foundational, feeds all other parts.


2. Minimal Modeling – prove the data is useful with basic models.


3. Basic LLM Chart Generator – fun and demo-worthy, even if it’s hacky at first.


4. Unified API + Dockerization – once you’ve got 2–3 features working.


5. Web Portal + Subscription – when you’re ready to demo and bring users onboard.
